## Description ##

Sometimes you want the top daily news articles right at your fingertips, but these are often stuck behind a paywall.  These news articles can also be difficult to read, especially for younger people or those who don't have English as thir primary language.  This web application solves both of these issues with ease.  Our headlines are pulled from Google News and put in an easy to access format.  In additon, every word in the headlines and the following snippets are interactive.  Clicking on a word will provide you with a definition, synonyms, and context to allow you to fully understand the articles in their entirety.
